# EasyDB

[![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/shencangsheng/easydb-backend.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/shencangsheng/easydb-backend)

EasyDB is an SQL assistant written in Rust, designed to streamline the process of querying text files. With EasyDB, you can treat multiple text files as a single database and perform SQL queries. It supports various file formats, including CSV, NdJson, JSON, xlsx and Parquet files, and works out of the box without the need for file conversion. 

powered by the high-performance and scalable query engine `DataFusion` written in Rust.

## üìñ Project Background

### From Server to App

[EasyDB Server](https://github.com/shencangsheng/easy_db) is mainly deployed on Linux servers as a web service supporting efficient querying of large-scale text files. Although Docker deployment solutions are provided, usage on macOS is still not convenient enough.

For this reason, I developed the [EasyDB App](https://github.com/shencangsheng/easydb_app) client, specifically optimized for macOS and Windows platforms to improve the local user experience.

### Project Naming

To better distinguish between the two projects:

- **EasyDB Server**: Server-side version, based on DataFusion
- **EasyDB App**: Desktop client version, based on Polars

## üìñ Features

- Support CSV
- Support NdJson
- Support TSV
- Support xlsx (**beta**)
- Use standard SQL statements to query file data

## üîÆ Roadmap

- [x] Optimize error messages
- [ ] Automatically recognize tables based on paths
- [ ] Automatically generate table schema
- [ ] Support outputting more data types
- [x] Support `select * from '/path/example.csv'` to directly access local files without needing to `create table` in advance
- [ ] Support remote files on s3
- [ ] Support JSON file
- [ ] Support multiple paths
- [ ] Support MySQL
- [ ] Support Parquet files
- [x] Support Tsv files
- [ ] Optimization of XLSX file performance (enhancing compatibility)
- [ ] Increase session duration to reduce file load frequency

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shencangsheng/easy_db.git
cd easy_db
docker compose up -d
# http://127.0.0.1:8088
```

### Examples

```sql
select * from '/var/lib/easydb/example/order*.csv'
```

```sql
create table user () location 'example/user.csv'
```

```sql
create table log () location 'example/2025*.log'
```

```sql
select *
from user as t1
inner join log as t2 on (t1.id = t2.user_id)
```
